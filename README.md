# Tripz Holidays Mock Server

A mock server for the Tripz Holidays travel booking application, providing RESTful API endpoints for testing and development purposes.

## Project Overview

Tripz Holidays Mock Server is a JSON-based mock API server designed to simulate backend functionality for a travel booking application. This mock server helps developers test and develop frontend applications without needing a complete backend infrastructure. It provides endpoints for managing destinations, bookings, users, and travel packages.

## Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for all resources
- **JSON-based Database**: Simple file-based data storage using `tripzholidays_db.json`
- **Multiple Resources**: 
  - Destinations
  - Travel Packages
  - Bookings
  - User Management
  - Reviews and Ratings
- **Quick Setup**: Minimal configuration required to get started
- **CORS Enabled**: Cross-origin requests supported for frontend integration
- **Search and Filter**: Query parameters for filtering and searching data

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monkovatechnologies/tripzholidays-mockServer.git
cd tripzholidays-mockServer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Install JSON Server (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g json-server
# or
yarn global add json-server
```

### 4. Start the Mock Server

```bash
json-server --watch tripzholidays_db.json --port 3000
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### 5. Access the API

Once running, you can access:
- API Root: `http://localhost:3000`
- Sample endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/destinations`

## API Usage

### Base URL

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Available Endpoints

Refer to `README_Tripzholidays_Mock_API.md` for detailed API documentation including:

- **GET** requests for fetching data
- **POST** requests for creating new entries
- **PUT/PATCH** requests for updating existing entries
- **DELETE** requests for removing entries

### Example Requests

#### Get All Destinations
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/destinations
```

#### Get Specific Destination by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/destinations/1
```

#### Create New Booking
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": 1, "destinationId": 5, "bookingDate": "2025-11-15"}'
```

#### Update Booking
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/bookings/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": 1, "destinationId": 5, "bookingDate": "2025-11-20", "status": "confirmed"}'
```

#### Delete Booking
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/bookings/1
```

### Query Parameters

JSON Server supports various query parameters:

- **Filter**: `?field=value`
- **Paginate**: `?_page=1&_limit=10`
- **Sort**: `?_sort=field&_order=asc`
- **Search**: `?q=searchterm`

## Database Structure

The mock database (`tripzholidays_db.json`) contains the following collections:

- `destinations` - Travel destinations with details
- `packages` - Travel packages and deals
- `bookings` - User bookings and reservations
- `users` - User account information
- `reviews` - Customer reviews and ratings

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Custom Port

To run on a different port:

```bash
json-server --watch tripzholidays_db.json --port 8080
```

### Enable CORS

CORS is enabled by default in JSON Server, but you can customize headers if needed.

## Testing

You can test the API using:

- **Postman**: Import endpoints and test manually
- **cURL**: Command-line testing (examples above)
- **Browser**: GET requests can be tested directly in the browser
- **Frontend Application**: Integrate with your React/Angular/Vue application
